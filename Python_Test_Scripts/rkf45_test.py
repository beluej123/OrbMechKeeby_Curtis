    The numerical integration is done by the function 'rkf45' which uses
    the subfunction 'rates' herein to compute the derivatives.
    
    x     - displacement (km)
    '     - shorthand for d/dt

            acceleration and RE is the radius of the earth
    x0    - initial value of x
    v0    = initial value of the velocity (x')
    y0    - column vector containing x0 and v0
    t0    - initial time
    tf    - final time
    tspan - a row vector with components t0 and tf
    t     - column vector of the times at which the solution is found
    f     - a matrix whose columns are:
            column 1: solution for x at the times in t
            column 2: solution for x' at the times in t
